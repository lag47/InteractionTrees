(** * Composition of [asm] programs *)

(** We develop in this file a theory of linking for [asm] programs.
    To this end, we will equip them with four main combinators:
    - [pure_asm], casting pure functions into [asm]. 
    - [app_asm], linking them vertically
    - [link_asm], hiding internal links
    - [relabel_asm], allowing to rename labels
    Viewing [asm] units as diagrams, whose entry wires are the exposed labels of
    its blocks, and exit wires the external labels to which it may jump, this
    theory can be seen in particular as showing that they enjoy a structure of
    _traced monoidal category_.
    We do so by thinking of [ktree]s as a theory of linking at the denotational
    level. Each linking combinator is therefore proved correct by showing that
    the denotation of the resulting [asm], a [ktree],  can be swapped with the
    corresponding [ktree] combinator.
    It is interesting to notice that while the [ktree] theory, provided by the
    library, required heavy use of coinduction, it provides sufficient reasoning
    principles so that we do not need to write any cofix here.

(** A utility function to apply renaming functions [f] and [g] respectively to
    the entry and exit labels of a [bks]. *)
Definition relabel_bks {A B C D : nat} (f : F A -> F B) (g : F C -> F D)
           (b : bks B C) : bks A D :=
  fun a => fmap_block g (b (f a)).

Definition raw_asm {A B} (b : bks A B) : asm A B :=

(** And so does a single [block] in particular. *)

(** ** [asm] combinators *)

(** We now turn to the proper [asm] combinators. *)

(** An [asm] program made only of external jumps.
    This is useful to connect programs with [app_asm]. *)
Definition pure_asm {A B: nat} (f : F A -> F B) : asm A B :=
  raw_asm (fun a => bbb (Bjmp (f a))).

Definition id_asm {A} : asm A A := pure_asm id.

(** The [app_asm] combinator joins two [asm] programs, 
    preserving their internal links.
    Since the three ambient domains of labels are extended,
    the only tricky part is to rename all labels appropriately.

(** Combinator to append two asm programs, preserving their internal links.
    Can be thought of as a "vertical composition", or a tensor product. 
 *)
(* We build a function from F X into block (F Y), we hence cannot use case_ whether over iFun or sktree.
   Can we do better?

Definition app_asm {A B C D} (ab : asm A B) (cd : asm C D) :
  asm (A + C) (B + D) :=
  {| internal := ab.(internal) + cd.(internal);
     code := relabel_bks Foo Foo (app_bks ab.(code) cd.(code))
  |}.

(** Rename visible program labels.
    Having chosen to represent labels as binary trees encoded in [Type],
    we, for instance, typically need to rename our visible labels through
    associators.
    The following generic combinator allow any relabelling. 
 *)
Definition relabel_asm {A B C D} (f : F A -> F B) (g : F C -> F D)
           (bc : asm B C) : asm A D :=
  {| code := relabel_bks (bimap id f) (bimap id g)  bc.(code); |}.

(** Labels that are exposed both as entry and exit points can be internalized.
    This operation can be seen as linking two programs internal to [ab] together.
 *)
Definition link_asm {I A B} (ab : asm (I + A) (I + B)) : asm A B :=
  {| internal := ab.(internal) + I;
     code := relabel_bks assoc_r assoc_l ab.(code);
  |}.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Correctness *)
(** We show the combinators correct by proving that their denotation
    map to their [ktree] counterparts.
    Since these combinators are the basic blocks we'll use in the
    compiler to link compiled subterms, these correctness lemmas
    will provide an equational theory sufficient to conduct
    all needed reasoning.
    Interestingly, [ktree] provides a sufficiently rich theory to
    prove all these results involving [denote_asm], which is expressed
    as a [loop], equationally.

       [compose_loop] and [loop_compose] are the _naturality_ in _X_ and _Y_.
       [loop_loop] is the second _vanishing_ law.

(** We have defined four low-level combinators allowing us to combine [asm]
    programs together. These combinators are correct in the sense that
    their denotation is bisimilar to their denotational counterparts at the
    [ktree] level.
    This theory of linking is only tied to _Asm_, and can therefore be reused
    either for other compilers targeting Asm, or for optimizations over Asm. 
    We now turn to its specific use to finally define our compiler, defined
    in [Imp2Asm.v].
