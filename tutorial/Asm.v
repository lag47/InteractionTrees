(** ** Syntax *)

(** We define a countable set of memory addresses, represented as [string]s: *)
Definition addr : Set := string.

(** We define a set of register names (for this simple example, we identify them
with [nat]). *) 
Definition reg : Set := nat.

(** For simplicity, _Asm_ manipulates [nat]s as values too. *)
Definition value : Set := nat. 

(** We consider constants and variables as operands. *)
Variant operand : Set :=
| Oimm (_ : value)
| Oreg (_ : reg).

(** The instruction set covers moves and arithmetic operations, as well as load
    and stores to the heap.  *)
Variant instr : Set :=
| Imov   (dest : reg) (src : operand)
| Iadd   (dest : reg) (src : reg) (o : operand)
| Isub   (dest : reg) (src : reg) (o : operand)
| Imul   (dest : reg) (src : reg) (o : operand)
| Iload  (dest : reg) (addr : addr)
| Istore (addr : addr) (val : operand).

(** We consider both direct and conditional jumps *)
Variant branch {label : Type} : Type :=
| Bjmp (_ : label)                (* jump to label *)
| Bbrz (_ : reg) (yes no : label) (* conditional jump *)
| Bhalt
.
Global Arguments branch _ : clear implicits.

(** A basic [block] is a sequence of straightline instructions followed by a
    branch that either halts the execution, or transfers control to another
    [block]. *)
Inductive block {label : Type} : Type :=
| bbi (_ : instr) (_ : block)
| bbb (_ : branch label).
Global Arguments block _ : clear implicits.



(** A piece of code should expose the set of labels allowing to enter into it,
    as well as the set of outer labels it might jump to.  To this end, [bks]
    represents a collection of blocks labeled by [F A], with branches in [F B]. 
*)

Definition bks A B := F A -> block (F B).


(** An [asm] program represents the control flow of the computation.  It is a
    collection of labelled [blocks] such that its labels are classified into
    three categories:

    - [A]: (visible) entry points

    - [B]: (visible) exit points

    - [internal]: (hidden) internal linked labels

    Note that they uniformely represent open and closed programs, the latter
    corresponding to an [asm] program with a unique entry point and no exit
    labels, i.e. a [asm unit void].  Note that using [void] to describe the exit
    points means that closed program must either diverge (go into an infinite
    loop) or somehow generate an event that terminates them.  (See the
    denotation of [Bhalt] below.)  *)

Record asm (A B: nat) : Type :=
  {
    internal : nat;
    code     : bks (internal + A) (internal + B)
  }.

Arguments internal {A B}.
Arguments code {A B}.

(** ** Semantics *)

(** _Asm_ produces two kind of events for manipulating its two kinds of state:
    registers and the heap.  
*)
Class HasReg (m : Type -> Type) : Type :=
  { get_reg : reg -> m value
  ; set_reg : reg -> value -> m unit
  }.

Class HasMemory (m : Type -> Type) : Type :=
  { load : addr -> m value
  ; store : addr -> value -> m unit
  }.

(* SAZ: Move Exit to the itrees library? *)
(** We also introduce a special event to model termination of the computation.
    Note that it expects _actively_ no answer from the environment: [Done] is
    of type [Exit void].  We can therefore use it to "close" an [itree E A] no
    matter what the expected return type [A] is, as witnessed by the [exit]
    computation.  *)
Class MonadExit (m : Type -> Type) : Type :=
  exit : forall a, m a.

Arguments exit {m _ a}.

      (** A labelled collection of blocks, [bks], is simply the pointwise
          application of [denote_block].  However, its denotation is therefore
          crucially a [ktree], whose structure will be useful in the proof of
          the compiler.

          The type [ktree E A B] is shorthand for [A -> itree E B], and we can
          think of them as "continuations" with events in E.  They have a nice
          algebraic structure, supported by the library, including a [loop]
          combinator that we can use to link collections of basic blocks. (See
          below.) *)

    End with_labels.

  (** One can think of an [asm] program as a circuit/diagram where wires
      correspond to jumps/program links.  [denote_bks] computes the meaning of
      each basic block as an [itree] that returns the label of the next block to
      jump to, laying down all our elementary wires.  In order to denote an [asm
      A B] program as a [ktree E A B], it therefore remains to wire all those
      denoted blocks together while hiding the internal labels.  Luckily, that
      is exactly what traced monoidal category are good for.  We therefore
      accomplish this with the same [loop] combinator we used to denote _Imp_'s
      [while] loop.  It directly takes our [denote_bks (code s): ktree E (I + A)
      (I + B)] and hides [I] as desired.  *)

compiling expressions and basic statements will be mostly straightforward; - but
linking the resulting elementary (open) [asm] programs together is not as
trivial. In particular, reasoning inductively on this linking is more
challenging.  We therefore take a detour: we first reason in isolation about
linking, and to this end we jump to [AsmCombinators.v].  *)
